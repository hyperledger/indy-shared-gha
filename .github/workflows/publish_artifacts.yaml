        # Trusted Publishing Support
        # - https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish?tab=readme-ov-file#trusted-publishing
        # - Though pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish supports trusted publishing, trusted publishing is not
        #   supported within reusable workflows.
        # - Since we're using pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish from within a reusable workflow
        #   we are unable to use trusted publishing.
        # - Following the guidance to use trusted publishing requires the action be called
        #   from the top-level (in the non-reusable workflow).  Since publishing is common
        #   to the indy projects this would create unwanted code duplication.
        # - The hope is trusted publishing will be supported from within reusable workflows
        #   in the future.
